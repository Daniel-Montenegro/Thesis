-- Language support

To get language support in various languages we need to set in PhDtehissPSnPDF.cls

\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\usepackage[spanish,english,activeacute]{babel}


You can specify all three languages in the babel options, where the last one is the default language for the document.

Code: Select all
    \usepackage[portuges,french,english]{babel}


Wherever you need, you can switch to a certain language and write your text in this language.

Code: Select all
    \selectlanguage{portuges}


This is supposed to be for longer text passages. For short text you can use another command.

Code: Select all
    \foreignlanguage{portuges}{Short text in Portuguese}


For more information refer to the babel manual and study it thoroughly.


Caution: when \selectlanguage is used, improved translations are lots
